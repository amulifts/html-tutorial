## HTML

<a name="html"></a>

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a **markup language** used to create and structure web pages. HTML is the **foundation** of all websites and provides the **structure** for displaying text, images, videos, and other types of content on the web.

HTML consists of a series of **elements** and **attributes** that are used to describe the content and structure of a web page. For example, the "p" element is used to create a **paragraph**, the "a" element is used to create a **link**, and the "img" element is used to display an **image**.

Each HTML element is surrounded by tags, which are used to define the start and end of an element. For example, the code for a paragraph might look like this:

```html
<p> This is a paragraph of text. </p>
```

HTML can be written using a text editor and viewed in a web browser. When a web browser loads an HTML document, it displays the content and structure defined by the HTML code.

In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while other technologies like CSS and JavaScript are used to style and add interactivity to the page.
